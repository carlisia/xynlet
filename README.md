# Xynlet App

# External dependencies
None, only std lib has been used.

# Notes on commits
Normally I squash commits into a whole unit of work, usually having it correspond to a task or story. For this project, I chose to leave commits as smaller units. Also, longish commentaries are included on the body of commit messages as a (probably very poor!) attempt to give a sense of what it would've been like to pair-program with me during the code implementation.
